## What is This?
This is a very simple password generation script I've written in python as a proof of concept more than anything else.
The script allows the user to ask for a certain character length and amount (sets) of passwords, all of which being alphanumeric.
## Installation
Before using this script, you **MUST** ensure your system has the [Click](http://click.pocoo.org/5/) module installed, otherwise the script will not work!
Open your system command prompt and enter: `$ pip install click`

Do note that [Click](http://click.pocoo.org/5/) supports Python 3.4 and newer, Python 2.7, and PyPy (more documentation [here](https://github.com/pallets/click))
## Contributions
If you have any suggestions as to additional functionality that you'd like to see in the script, simply submit an issue ticket with your suggestion and it will be considered!
